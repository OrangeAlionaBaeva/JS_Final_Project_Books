                        Do you want to develop a skill that will ensure you never go jobless again? Have you always wanted to learn how to program but could never afford those ridiculously expensive courses? Developers and programmers are amongst the highest paid professions
                        in the world, and according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of jobs for software and app developers will increase by a shocking 24% in the next few years. In 2019, the tech industry posted 4.6 million job openings
                        in the US job market, and their direct economic output was estimated at 1.9 trillion dollars. There’s no doubt that the IT industry is the future, and software, web, and app developers are and will be the most coveted professionals
                        for many years to come. But here’s the shock you may not have seen coming: the IT industry has a backdoor--you only need to know how to open it in order to jump straight on that cash wagon. The key to that door is JavaScript, a
                        programming language that has withstood the test of time and has become one of the most used languages. You might have heard about some of the companies that use JavaScript: Netflix, Google, Microsoft, eBay, Facebook, Uber, PayPal…
                        The list goes on and on. Being proficient in JavaScript will basically ensure that you never run out of job options. As with pursuing any new concept, learning how to program can be intimidating, especially for beginners. Even
                        though JavaScript is incredibly beginner-friendly, it’s still complex enough for you to need a guide to lead you through the process of mastering it.
