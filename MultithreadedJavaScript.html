                        Thanks to recent advancements in the platform—such as with web workers in the browser, worker_threads in Node.js, and the Atomics and SharedArrayBuffer objects—JavaScript engineers are able to build multi-threaded applications.
                        These features will go down as being the biggest paradigm shift for the world's most popular programming language. Multithreaded JavaScript explores the various features that JavaScript runtimes have at their disposal for implementing
